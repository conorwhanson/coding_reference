This 2020 census redistricting geography database of the 7 county metropolitan area and the additional 12 collar county area was developed from the U.S. Census Bureau's Redistricting Census 2020 TIGER/Line files.

The Metropolitan Council downloaded this data from the Census Bureau's FTP site and created block, block group, tract, county subdivision (city), and county datasets from the original data. The block dataset was updated on Jan. 12, 2023 to add new Census Bureau urban and rural designations.</abstract><purpose>For mapping and analysis of data from the U. S.

Statewide shape files were downloaded from the Census Bureau TIGER FTP site https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html for the following 2020 boundaries: County, County Subdivisions, Tract, Block Group and Block.  7-county metro area was selected from each statewide shapefile and saved as a new shapefile.  9 MN collar counties and 3 WI collar counties were selected from each statewide shapefile and saved as a new shapefile - then Appended to 1-collar county shape file.
