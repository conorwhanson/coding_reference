            <abstract>This dataset reflects the zip code boundaries that are based on the physical address of the Hennepin County parcel attribute. These data are maintained on an as-needed basis and are to be used as a general approximation of the area serviced by the U.S. Postal Service.Â It is important to note that Hennepin County has decided to not use the U.S. Census Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) dataset as it is not as accurate as our parcel-based data.</abstract>
            <purpose>This dataset reflects the zip code boundaries which are based on the Hennepin County parcel attributes of physical mailing address.</purpose>
