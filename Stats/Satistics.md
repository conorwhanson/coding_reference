# Statistics for Data Science/Analysis
### Descriptive Statistics
**Measures of central tendency**
*How centered the data is*
- Mean
- Median
- Mode

**Measures of dispersion**
*How dispersed the data is*
- Range: difference between largest and smallest number in dataset
- Variance: how much each data point varies from the mean
- Standard Deviation: square root of variance; how far, on avg, each datapoint is from the mean

### Inferential Statistics
Making inferences about a population based on representative sample data.
- **T-tests**: compare means of two groups to see if there is a statistically significant difference (NTE: pay attention to dataset variance that could mislead)
- **ANOVA (analysis of variance)**: compare the means of more than two groups.
- **Chi-square**: Used to compare distribution of frequencies of categorical data across two groups
- **Correlation**: How strongly or weakly two variables are related. Calculated with correlation coefficient (denoted as *r* between -1 and 1; negative or positive depending on direction of relationship)
- **Regression**: predict a continuous (i.e., numerical) dependent var based on 1 (or more) independent vars fitted to an equation line

### Sampling Methods
1. Random sampling: each member of population has an equal chance of being selected
2. Systematic sampling: select every *n*th number, which is determined by desired sample size
3. Stratified random sampling: divide population into groups (strata), then randomly sample
4. Cluster sampling: divide population into groups (clusters) and randomly select the clusters to include in sample
5. Convenience sampling: selecting participants based on their availability/willingness to participate
6. Quota sampling: slecting a certain number of participants from specific subgroups within the population
