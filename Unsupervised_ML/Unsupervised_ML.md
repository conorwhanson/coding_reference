# Unsupervised Machine Learning
Takes in data with **no paired inputs and no known output/target**. This is used to find patterns or groups that may exist in the data. The only input is the entire dataset.

Like Supervised learning, Unsupervised only takes in **numerical values**.

Unsupervised learning has two methods:

1. **Transforming** the entire dataset into an intuitive viz for analysis or for use in another (supervised) ML model. This makes raw data easier to understand.
2. **Clustering** data determines patterns/similarities in various groupings of data points.

Unsupervised learning can help to explore data if you're not sure what you're looking for, which also means it can be hard to determine if the results are correct/representative of reality.

Prior to running Unsupervised algorithms we need to 
**Select** data => make choices about which data to use/include.
**Process** data => organize data (format, clean, sample, etc).
**Transform** data => for ease of future use; format into database, spreadsheet, csv, etc.
