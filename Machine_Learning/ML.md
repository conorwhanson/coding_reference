## Machine Learning Fundamentals
Using statistical algorithms to perform tasks, but specifically to learn from data patterns for making future predictions.

Basic ML flow:
1. ML model is given a dataset
2. ML algorithm analyzes the data, attempting to identify patterns.
3. Based on patterns found the model makes predictions on new data.

#### Generally there are 3 ML categories:

1. **Supervised** deals with labeled data. Dataset divided into features (variables for prediction) and targets (predicted outcome(s))
    - Regression: prediction based on continuous variables (i.e. numeric data)
    - Classification: prediction based on discrete outcomes. Primarily differentiated from regression by a binary outcome.
2. **Unsupervised** deals with data without labeled outcomes (finds patterns given the dataset itself)
3. **Deep**
