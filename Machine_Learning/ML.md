## Machine Learning Fundamentals
Using statistical algorithms to perform tasks, but specifically to learn from data patterns for making future predictions.

Generally there are **3** ML categories:
---------------------------------
1. **Supervised** deals with labeled data
2. **Unsupervised** deals with data without labeled outcomes (finds patterns given the dataset itself)
3. **Deep**
