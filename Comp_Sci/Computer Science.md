## Computer Science
Computers are collections of transistors:
 - A transistor is on (1) or off (0) and represents a **bit**
 - Combinations of transistors create binary code (10010101)
 - A byte is **8** bits (00000001)
 - Computers use Base-2 counting: Byte --> 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
 - Mapping of bytes to numbers/letters was set by the ACSII
 - Unicode a mapping of numbers to letters
 - Colors are represented by RGB (255,255,255) in each pixel of the screen
 - Videos are changing pixels over time

#### Abstraction
High-level thinking that guides action. 

In CS abstraction is:
    Input $\to$ algorithm $\to$ Output 

    Write **Pseudocode** to outline the flow/logic

Humans write **source code**, computers output/execute **machine code**.

**Compiler** converts source code to machine code.

Code evaluation focuses on *correctness, design, and style*.

#### Data type size
**bool** --> 1 byte
**int** --> 4 bytes
**long** --> 8 bytes
**float** --> 4 bytes
**double** --> 8 bytes
**char** --> 1 byte
**string** --> ??? bytes

#### Python
