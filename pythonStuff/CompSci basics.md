# Data Structures
- Tuple --> immutable
- Set --> 
- List --> cannot have duplicate values. Built-in Python methods/functions:
.index, .append (add to end of list), .pop(provide index and removes it, retains value), .remove (does not save value, provide value)
- Dictionaries --> contain key value pairs (string mapped to extractable value)

All these data structures can be combined**** Nesting

# Data Types
Integers --> positive or negative whole numbers for math calculations (comp memory determines integer size)

Floating-point decimal numbers --> numbers with decimals used for math calculations

Strings --> text or number wrapped in single or double quotes (called delimiters, which are non alphabetical characters to delineate the boundary between text and numbers). Cannot be used for math calculations**

Boolean --> true or false

# Variables
Variable --> store an integer, floating-point decimal number, string, or boolean value.(e.g. name = conor)
# Loops
Two kinds: For & While
For --> Run for a specific amount of time (specified)
While --> Runs until a condition is met (specified)

# Conditionals

# Functions
.head() takes the first five rows in a DataFrame
.describe() prints out a DataFrame with summary of stats
.info() metadata about DataFrame
unique() returns distinct/unique values
value_counts() runs a groupby() and a count() behind the scenes***

# CSVs
Comma Separated Values
No size limit**

# Joins
Joins tell the program what to keep when merging data tables
Left Outer Join = Keeps everything in left data set, fills in null values where applicable. Flip variables to do a right join***
Inner Join --> Grab results that are in both tables
Outer Join --> keeps all values from all tables

By default, a merger perfoms an inner join ***
