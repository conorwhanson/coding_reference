# Module 4: Local Storage Devices
**Memory** - RAM and ROM are computer chips that store data.
- RAM is volatile, short-term, deletes data if shut off, but faster data fetching. Background processes and clipboard are examples.
- ROM is non-volatile, long-term, keeps data if shut off, but slower fetching. Computer booting is an example.

**Hard Drive (HD, HDD)**
- Large storage capacity with spinning magnetic plates. Can overheat. These were standard for a long time.

**Solid-state Drive (SSD)**
- Fastest storage option, no moving parts, doesn't need power to retain data, much faster than HDs. Newest method of storage.

**Solid-state Hybrid Drive**
- Integrate SSD and HD and switches based on user activity.

**Optical Disk Drive (ODD)**
- DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, etc. Reflect light with laser to read data.

**Flash Drives**
- Store data on SSD,, low energy consumption. Small, fast, inexpensive; smaller capacity than HDDs or larger SSDs.

### Hybrid Disk Array
Pysically combine multiple SSD and HDD devices into array of drives working together to achieve the fast performance of SSDs and lower costs of HDDs. Small, fast, low-cost setup; performance concerns and complex to maintain.

### Direct Attached Storage (DAS)
One or more storage units within external enclosure which is directly attached to the computer accessing. External drives are portable DASs.

**Ephemeral storage** is where data is deleted on restart.
**Persistent Storage** keeps data on restart. Most drives are per
