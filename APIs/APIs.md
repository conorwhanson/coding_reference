# APIs 
Application Programming Interface
(Request/Response; Client/Server)

2 components to API requests: 
- requests.get(url) sends a GET to the URL passed as a parameter
- .json() a call to convert the response object into a JSON format; a list of dictionaries or dictionary of lists.

One computer sends a request to another server (via fiber optic cables), the receiving computer fulfills the request and sends the packet of data back. A protocol which allows computers to talk and share information with one another.

Post-request: encodes information in the body
Get-request: encodes information in the URL
