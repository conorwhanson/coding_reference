# JavaScript
Fundamental building block for every website on the internet; Web-based language.

Back to the CompSci basics:
1. Loops
2. Conditionals
3. Variables/Data Structure
4. Functions

JavaScript is the muscle of websites; it powers the actions/interactions.

JavaScript listens for events and responds accordingly. Used to request info from a server. You can also dynamically modify HTML elements (i.e. interact with and respond to user).

You need a website to run JS. It's commonly found in HTML.

Logically and syntactically similar to Python.

Keywords for variable declaration:
- var = generic variable irrespective of dtype (Python automatically does this)
- let = temp variable (for temp i in list:)
- const = immutable variable

JS String: console.log(`Hello ${name}!`) 

JS Function: var weeklyWage = hourlyWage * parseInt(weeklyHours);
