# SQLite and SQLAlchemy with Python
SQLite is a locally hosted database, and SQLAlchemy is a Python library and can be used to connect to any SQL database. Input and output can be done in Python, output can be run in Pandas. SQLite databases are typically smaller than other SQL databases.

ORM = Object Relational Mapper (allows the creation of classes to map onto tables in a database. The maps are decoupled and can be manipulated without damaging the table)
