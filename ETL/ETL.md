Raw data to cleaned and database pipeline

### 3 Big functions for data transformation:
- Lambdas: functions without names (ambiguous); can transform data without a for loop! They only exist in their local place in the code and cannot be called outside of that place. Fast and effective for small and simple tranformations.

- Regular expressions (regex): search/filter an string for all occurrences of a reg ex and returns matches. These can be used to match patterns. This goes beyond Python to all coding languages, text editors, etc. Typically represented by .*

- List comprehensions : uses a conditional expression to do a 1-line for loop, returns a list. 

**Limit using Lambdas and list comprehension to replace easy for loops**

Classes organize groups of functions that are related (often classes for E, T, and L)
