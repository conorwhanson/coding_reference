# R
Statistical open-source programming language.

R is built on 2 fundamentals: data structures & functions.

- Named values <- variables given a name (e.g. x <- 3; where <- is an assignment operator)
- Vectors <- arrays/lists
- Numeric vector <- ordered list of numbers; numlist <- c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) where c() function means 'concatenate', in data environment the object is displayed as: num [1:10] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, where num is data type and brackets contain rows (1) and columns (10).
- Matrix <- a vector of vectors, each value is same data type.
