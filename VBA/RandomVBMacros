To count rows automatically in a single column, use: RowCount = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row

To format numbers as percentages, use: Range("C4:C15").NumberFormat = "0.00%"

To format numbers as currency (with a $ sign), use: Range("B4:B15").NumberFormat = "$ ##, ###, ##0.00"

To autofit data in columns, use: Columns("").AutoFit

Declaring a variable as Single = less memory, but no decimal. Double is decimal, but more memory.

Blah blah blah
